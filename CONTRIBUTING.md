Thank you for your interest in contributing.

### Before you contribute

Before we can use your code you must sign a contributor license agreement. There are two types:

- [Individual CLA](TODO): When code is not written on behalf of an organization.
- [Organization CLA](TODO): For contributing code written on behalf of an org.

This is necessary because you own the copyright to the code you write. In order for us to use and distribute your code we thus need your permission.

It's also a good idea before you write a contribution to get in touch with us via an existing GitHub issue or by opening a new one. This can help find alignment between people with similar interests as well as be a way to source design and other guidance before you start building.

### Code reviews

All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We use Github pull requests for this purpose.

### Coding style

Python code conforms to the [Google Python Style Guide](http://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html). You can autoformat your code using the [yapf](https://github.com/google/yapf) utility.
